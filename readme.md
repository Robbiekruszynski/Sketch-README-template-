README Sections for Sketch Projects
READMEs of all Sketch projects created in this course must (at a minimum) include the following. This will also be graded in code reviews:

* Project Title
* Project Description
Write a few sentences that describe what the project does, what its goals are, what you've learned, etc. Don't skimp here! This is an opportunity to highlight your hard work to employers.
* Your Name(s)
Names of all contributors to the project.
* Photos of Paper Sketches
We highly recommend you snap quick photos of your paper sketches, and include them in your README. This depicts your process, and you will be required to include them for larger projects and Friday independent projects.
* Screenshots of Sketch Wireframes
This is really important! Include images of the user interfaces your project includes here in the README. (This includes any mobile or tablet versions.) Oftentimes potential employers don't have time to clone and launch projects. Make it easy for them to see the amazing work you've done. You're working so hard here at Epicodus; so make that work evident. Don't hesitate to show it off.
* List of User Stories and Personas
Don't worry about this one quite yet! We'll explore what these are in Monday night's homework.
* List of Technologies Resources
* List all technologies and outside resources your project uses. Especially when we begin using outside UI frameworks in week three! Not only does this give credit where credit is due, but it shows employers what tools you're experienced in.
* Setup Instructions
Similar to what we've done in previous courses, describe the steps necessary to launch this project in Sketch.
* Description of Responsiveness
After we begin creating responsive sites in week 3, you should also include a description of how this site is responsive. Does it include both mobile and desktop versions? Mobile, desktop and tablet? List that information here.
* Developmental Roadmap
Is there work you plan on continuing doing on this project? Features you'd like to add? If so, describe what your future intentions are in this section.
* Licensing
Like we've been doing since Intro, make sure to list what license you'd like applied to this project.
You are not necessarily required to use these exact heading names, or include information in this exact order/format, we simply expect that all of these details are included in all User Interfaces project READMEs in whatever order and format you choose.


Given positive integers A, B, and N, write a program that prints integers from 1 to N. But for integers that are multiples of A, print 'F', and for multiples of B, print 'B'. For integers which are multiples of both A and B, print 'FB'.
Input:
Your program should read lines of text from standard input. Each line will contain A, B, and N as space-delimited positive integers.
Output:
For each line of input, print to standard output a line of space-delimited integers 1 through N, replacing integers as described above.
